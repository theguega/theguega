# Hi, I'm <a href="https://theguega.github.io/personal/">Theo Guegan</a> 🤖

I enjoy building robots from the embedded code that moves them to the machine learning models that make them think.

My goal is to make robotics open and accessible to everyone, connecting hardware and intelligence through systems that inspire people to experiment, learn, and build real robots.

# Experience

🚀 **Hackathons**  
Participated in the **SWARM Hackathon 2025**, where we designed a swarm robotics concept for future space exploration using the **HeRo 2.0 platform**. Earned **2nd place among 100 participants** for technical depth and vision.

🛩️ **Drone Software Engineer - Thales, France**  
Built a **real-time embedded Lua engine** in C++ for drone scripting, reducing mission prototyping time by **4×**.  
Integrated a local LLM (in Rust) for **natural-language drone commands**.

🤖 **Machine Learning - Palo Alto, CA**  
Currently, I’m exploring VLAs and embodied intelligence at a robotics startup in Palo Alto.
