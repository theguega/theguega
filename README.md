# Hi, I'm <a href="https://theguega.github.io/personal/">Theo Guegan</a> 👋

I’m completing my Master’s in Computer Engineering (UWaterloo – Canada | UTC – France) with a focus on robotics and intelligent systems.

I enjoy building robots end to end — from the embedded code that moves them to the machine learning models that make them think.

My goal is to make robotics open and accessible to everyone, connecting hardware and intelligence through systems that inspire people to experiment, learn, and build real robots.

# About Me

🚀 **Hackathons**  
Participated in the **SWARM Hackathon 2025**, where we designed a swarm robotics concept for future space exploration using the **HeRo 2.0 platform**. Earned **2nd place among 100 participants** for technical depth and vision.

🛩️ **Previous Internship – Thales (France)**  
Built a **real-time embedded Lua engine** in C++ for drone scripting, reducing mission prototyping time by **4×**.  
Integrated a local LLM (in Rust) for **natural-language drone commands**.

🤖 **Next Internship – Robotics Machine Learning (Palo Alto - CA)**  
Joining as a **Robotics Machine Learning Intern** — focusing on real-world integration of perception, control, multimodal learning, teleoperation data, and foundation-model integration for embodied robots.

🧠 **Currently Building – SO-101 Robot**  
Experimenting with the latest **VLA** models and environments from the **🤗 LeRobot** community. Pushing **open-source robotics** a step closer to real-world autonomy.
