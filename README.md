🎯 **About Me**

I’m completing my Master’s in Computer Engineering with a focus on robotics and intelligent systems. 

I enjoy building robots end to end — from the embedded code that moves them to the machine learning models that make them think. My goal is to develop reliable, real-world systems that connect hardware and intelligence.
