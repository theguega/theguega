🎯 **About Me**

I'm a Robotics Software Engineer student passionate about building the next generation of intelligent machines. My work bridges real-time software and AI, combining C++, Python, and Rust to create autonomous systems that operate safely and efficiently in the real world.

My goal is to push the boundary between robotics and intelligence, contributing to the development of tomorrow’s robots that think and act with true autonomy.
