### üõ†Ô∏è Projects

- **TurtleBot Maze Mapping (ROS)**: Developed a maze-mapping solution for a TurtleBot using ROS. This project integrates a variety of sensors‚Äîcamera, LiDAR, ultrasound, and odometry‚Äîto autonomously explore and map unknown environments.

- **Autonomous Vehicle Control Architecture (MATLAB)**: Designed and implemented control architectures for autonomous vehicles, including adaptive control strategies for Automated Cruise Control (ACC), static obstacle avoidance, and waypoint navigation.

- **Internship at Thales LAS - Autonomous Drone Swarm**: Working with Thales LAS on autonomous drone swarms, where I am developing an embedded scripting engine using Lua for real-time dynamic control. The engine enables autonomous collaborative behavior and allows control of drones through scripts generated by a custom local LLM.
