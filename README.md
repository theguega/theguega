### üõ†Ô∏è Projects

- **TurtleBot Maze Mapping (ROS)**: A project where I implement maze mapping for a TurtleBot using ROS, integrating sensors such as a camera, LiDAR, ultrasound, and odometry to explore and map unknown environments.
  
- **Autonomous Vehicle Control Architecture (MATLAB)**: Designed and implemented a control architecture for autonomous vehicles in MATLAB, focusing on path planning, and adaptive control strategies depending on control mode.

- **Internship at Thales LAS - Autonomous Drone Swarm**: Currently working on control strategies, standardization of operational peripherals and embedded scripting engine for an autonomous drone swarm at Thales LAS, enhancing their collaborative and autonomous behavior in complex environments. see : [Thales d√©montre sa capacit√© √† d√©ployer des essaims de drones √† un niveau d‚Äôautonomie in√©gal√© gr√¢ce √† l‚ÄôIA](https://www.thalesgroup.com/fr/monde/defence-and-security/press_release/thales-demontre-sa-capacite-deployer-des-essaims-drones)
